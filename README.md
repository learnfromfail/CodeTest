# CodeTest

this is a code test given by a HR lady.
However, I hand in this to her late.
The reason why I am late because the configuration of servlet of Web dynamic module of version 3.1 is different from that of version 3.0.
Much time I nearly lost temper beacause the useless experience of debugging the bug of setting a project waste me a lot of time.

Q: how to open this?

host a server of MySQL with port 3306
host tomcat as server for jsp application, my tomcat server port number is 8888

url: localhost:8888/CodeTest/

the DBManager.java can vary the collection of MySQL database, to suit your need
the written ID : 'root'
the password (none): ''
