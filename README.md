# CodeTest

this is a code test given by a HR lady.
However, I hand in this to her late.
The reason why I am late because the configuration of servlet of Web dynamic module of version 3.1 is different from that of version 3.0.
Much time wasting on the useless experience of debugging the bug of setting a project.

Q: how to open this?

host a server of MySQL with port 3306
host tomcat as server for jsp application,
(my tomcat server port number is 8888)

url: localhost:8888/CodeTest/

the DBManager.java can vary the collection of MySQL database, 
to suit your need
the written ID : 'root'
the password (none): ''

Welcome to provide any comment

it may contain bug. I would like to a web host site to host it.
